# Maya scripts and stuff
Scripts and other handy maya things.

Most of the scripts are quite customized for my workflow or previous problems I've had to hack.
But it might serve as a base for something else hopefully!

## Contents
**scripts**

Sorted python scripts that should run in Maya.

**expressions**

Some expressions I've found useful.

**sandbox**

Random scripts and snippets that are either unfinished or just not suitable elsewhere. Don't expect anything to run.
