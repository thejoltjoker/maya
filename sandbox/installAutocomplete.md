If you write code for Maya in VSCode than maybe you’d like to have it autocomplete.

First of all, if you haven’t already installed the [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python) extension you should do that right away!

Open user settings (File > Preferences > Settings)
"python.autoComplete.extraPaths": ["C:/Program Files/Autodesk/Maya2016/devkit/other/pymel/extras/completion/py"]
"C:/Program Files/Autodesk/Maya2016/devkit/other/pymel/extras/completion/py"
